## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: ASP.NET Core 10.0 Razor Pages
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core 10.0 Web API
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Containerization**: Docker Desktop (for MongoDB)
- **Language**: C# (.NET 10)

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **.NET 10 SDK** - [Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)
2. **Docker Desktop** - [Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
3. **Visual Studio 2022** (or VS Code with C# extensions)
4. **Git** (optional, for version control)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Docker Desktop

1. Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Start Docker Desktop
3. Verify Docker is running: open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

### 2. Set Up MongoDB with Docker

Run MongoDB in a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password mongo:latest
```

**Note**: For development purposes, the application is configured to use a local MongoDB instance without authentication. For production, update the connection string in `appsettings.json` to include credentials.

To verify MongoDB is running:
```bash
docker ps
```

You should see the `mongodb` container in the list.

### 3. Clone or Navigate to the Project

```bash
cd C:\Users\Woody1130\source\repos\BDElite.Fleet
```

### 4. Restore Dependencies

Restore NuGet packages for both projects:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 5. Configure Connection Strings

The MongoDB connection string is already configured in:
- `BDElite.Fleet.API/appsettings.json`

Default configuration:
```json
{
  "MongoDbSettings": {
    "ConnectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
    "DatabaseName": "BDEliteFleet"
  }
}
```

The UI is configured to connect to the API at:
- `http://localhost:5132/` (configured in `BDElite.Fleet.UI/Program.cs`)

## Running the Application

### Option 1: Using Visual Studio 2022

1. Open `BDElite.Fleet.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Right-click the solution â†’ **Set Startup Projects**
3. Select **Multiple startup projects**
4. Set both `BDElite.Fleet.API` and `BDElite.Fleet.UI` to **Start**
5. Click **Start** (F5) or **Start Without Debugging** (Ctrl+F5)

### Option 2: Using Command Line

Open **two terminal windows**:

**Terminal 1 - Start the API:**
```bash
cd BDElite.Fleet.API
dotnet run
```

The API will start at `http://localhost:5132`

**Terminal 2 - Start the UI:**
```bash
cd BDElite.Fleet.UI
dotnet run
```

The UI will start at `https://localhost:5001` (or the URL shown in the terminal)

### Accessing the Application

Once both projects are running:

1. Open your browser and navigate to the UI URL (typically `https://localhost:5001`)
2. You'll see the landing page with three user portals:
   - **Fleet Dashboard** - `/FleetDashboard`
   - **Broker Portal** - `/BrokerPortal`
   - **Provider Console** - `/ProviderConsole`

## Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Connection Issues

If you encounter connection issues:

1. **Verify Docker is running:**
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

2. **Check MongoDB logs:**
   ```bash
   docker logs mongodb
   ```

3. **Restart MongoDB container:**
   ```bash
   docker restart mongodb
   ```

4. **Remove and recreate container:**
   ```bash
   docker rm -f mongodb
   docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:latest
   ```

### API Not Responding

1. Check that the API is running and listening on the correct port
2. Verify `BDElite.Fleet.UI/Program.cs` has the correct API base URL
3. Check for any firewall or antivirus blocking local connections

### Port Already in Use

If ports 5132 or 5001 are already in use:

1. Change the port in `launchSettings.json` (for both API and UI projects)
2. Update the API URL in `BDElite.Fleet.UI/Program.cs` to match
